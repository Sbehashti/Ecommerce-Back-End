### Developing A Back End For An E-Commerce Site, Configuring With Sequelize (ORM)
#### I was tasked with creating the back end for an e-commerce site by modifying starter code. I configured a working Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.

## Acceptance Criteria
- GIVEN a functional Express.js API, WHEN I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file, THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize;
- WHEN I enter schema and seed commands, THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data;
- WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application, THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database;
- WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia Core for categories, products, or tags, THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON;
- WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core, THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database.

## Work Completed
- Using Express.js API, Sequelize is able to interact with a MySQL database after the user has provided the necessary information in an environment variable file.
- When schema and seed commands are entered, a development database is created and seeded with test data.
- When the command to invoke the application is used, the server starts and the Sequelize models are synced to the MYSQL database.
- When API GET routes are used in Insomnia Core, the user is able to view the data for each of these routes in a formatted JSON.
- When Insomnia Core is used to test the API routes, the user is able to successfully create, update, and delete data in the database.
